### FAQ

* Do I need root privileges to use/apply this archive?

  No, you don't need root your phone

* What should I do if my keys are reset/returned to their previous values?
  
  You did not clear the data first, the ID information is still there, which should cause the data to be refreshed.
  
* what should I do my file manager cannot open `Android/data`?

  Android 11 and above does not allow this path to be opened, So please try to use `MT manager`, `Root Explorer` or others manager. (Don't worry, This usually does not require root privileges)

* Can I backup the save to Facebook?

  Yes, you can, but if you used it before, please stay logged in to Facebook, then replace file, though keys will be zero or keep the previous amount.

* What should I do if the content does not load after entering the game?

  Try to clear data and replace file again (This problem may occur on newly downloaded games.)
 
* Can I join co-op?

  Yes, you can.

 ### How to make keys?
 
1. If you can modify the game data, you can change the number of Ribbon (red, blue, yellow), then make keys in prize tent (If you changed the number of Ribbon more than 100, when you open the game next time, these number of Ribbon will back to 100)

2. Use `Gold Nets` to use treasure hunting mode, every time you can get two keys.
